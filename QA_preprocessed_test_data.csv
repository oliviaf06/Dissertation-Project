important skills when working with data science
curiosity creativity and critical thinking are all hallmarks of a successful data scientist and until recently getting the most out of data required a working knowledge of sql or statistical programming languages such as r or python however modern data science tools have opened the door to the business user or citizen data scientist as draganddrop visual data modeling has made nocode data science a reality
explore how people processes and technology interact in a data science project lifecycle tackling realworld industry challenges               why study data science
data science is a multidisciplinary approach to extracting actionable insights from the large and everincreasing volumes of data collected and created by todays organizations data science encompasses preparing data for analysis and processing performing advanced data analysis and presenting the results to reveal patterns and enable stakeholders to draw informed conclusions

data preparation can involve cleansing aggregating and manipulating it to be ready for specific types of processing analysis requires the development and use of algorithms analytics and ai models its driven by software that combs through data to find patterns within to transform these patterns into predictions that support business decisionmaking the accuracy of these predictions must be validated through scientifically designed tests and experiments and the results should be shared through the skillful use of data visualization tools that make it possible for anyone to see the patterns and understand trends

as a result data scientists as data science practitioners are called require computer science and pure science skills beyond those of a typical data analyst a data scientist must be able to do the following

apply mathematics statistics and the scientific method
use a wide range of tools and techniques for evaluating and preparing dataeverything from sql to data mining to data integration methods
extract insights from data using predictive analytics and artificial intelligence ai including machine learning and deep learning models
write applications that automate data processing and calculations
telland illustratestories that clearly convey the meaning of results to decisionmakers and stakeholders at every level of technical knowledge and understanding
explain how these results can be used to solve business problems
this combination of skills is rare and its no surprise that data scientists are currently in high demand
data science impact in the job market
market insights
in the 2018 august linkedin workforce report data science skills are in high demand across industries report linkedin reported that there were more than 151000 unfilled data scientist jobs across the us with acute shortages in new york city san francisco and los angeles combined with a 15 discrepancy between job postings and job searches on indeed demand for data scientists clearly outstrips supply

source francesco brenna giorgio danesi glenn finch brian goehring and manish goyal shifting toward enterprisegrade ai resolving data and skills gaps to realize value ibm institute for business value september 2018
to make matters worse there has been a lack of consistency in the skills required from candidates to fill a job in some cases job ads are too qualificationintensive makingit difficult to match skills to the job in other cases the candidates without the right qualifications are applying and being recruited as data scientists

this situation has left companies at risk of losing valuable time and opportunity and disappointing results from poor implementations and in worst cases when data science ml and ai techniques are used incorrectly theyre at risk of legal exposure for aspiring data scientists looking for better jobs this lack of consistency has left them unsure about which skills to develop to be successful in their careers

how completing this course could benefit you
although data science as a field has existed for several decades the rapid growth of artificial intelligence ai in business in the last five years has generated a demand for data scientists that far surpasses the availability of trained professionals
this talent gap is an opportunity for aspiring professionals and a challenge for companies striving for a competitive advantage in the market for prospective data scientists and organizations building a data science team gaining the necessary skills required can be a formidable obstacle

formalizing necessary skills helps academic institutions data scientists hiring managers and resource talent development teams deliver on the promise of data science machine learning ml and ai
