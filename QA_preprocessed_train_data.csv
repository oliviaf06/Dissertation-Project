introduction

in this topic we will in this topic well explore what digital transformation is the key transformation drivers and the technologies at the forefront of enterprise digital transformation   

throughout this topic we will attempt to answer the following questions

how have industries benefitted from adopting digital transformation practices
what role have technologies such as ai cloud and iot played in the digital revolution  
image showing gear and a key person in middle
1 how have industries benefitted from adopting digital transformation practices 

we are at one of the tipping points in history where the impact of technology on business is significant enough to transform the whole way that business gets done 

the new digital age 

its no secret that the pace of innovation and change has accelerated rapidly over the last few years from the explosion of social media to online shopping and apps to track your driver digital transformation has quickly become an integral part of daily life

abstract background with connected lines and futuristic digital background for ai and cloud technology
in every industry business leaders realize customer expectations have created tremendous pressure to change the way they set their strategies and run their organizations yet because they have to manage existing often traditional offerings and operations new requirements to incorporate information and interactivity quickly drive up costs and complexity

business leaders have long used information technology it to improve productivity and efficiency reach new markets and optimize supply chains whats new is that customer expectations have also changed people everywhere are using social networks to find jobs and restaurants lost friends and new partnersand as citizens to achieve common political goals they are using the internet for entertainment shopping socializing and household management

at the same time businesses are undertaking their own digital transformations rethinking what customers value most and creating operating models that take advantage of whats newly possible for competitive differentiation the challenge for business is how fast and how far to go on the path to digital transformation

what is digital transformation

collage of transformation drivers like using mobile devices social media iot devices cloud services
digital transformation takes a customerdriven digitalfirst approach to all aspects of a business from its business models to customer experiences to processes and operations it uses ai automation hybrid cloud and other digital technologies to leverage data and drive intelligent workflows faster and smarter decisionmaking and realtime response to market disruptions and ultimately it changes customer expectations and creates new business opportunities

while many organizations have undertaken a digital transformation in response to a single competitive threat or market shift it has never been about making a onetime fix according to mit sloan management review digital transformation is better thought of as continual adaptation to a constantly changing environment its goal is to build a technical and operational foundation to evolve and respond in the best possible way to unpredictable and everchanging customer expectations market conditions and local or global events 

digital transformation drivers 

customer expectations have always been the prime drivers of digital transformation it began when a rush of new technologies made new kinds of information and capabilities accessible in new ways such as 

mobile devices
social media
the internet of things iot
cloud computing
pioneersdisruptorssuch as amazon and netflix snatched market share from their competition by adopting these technologies to

reinvent business models ecommerce electronic delivery
optimize processes supply chain management new feature development
constantly improve the customer experience incontext customer reviews personalized recommendations
competitors adapted to provide even more capability and convenience or they struggled and maybe even disappeared today customers expect to conduct all business digitally wherever and whenever using any device with all the supporting information and content they need close at hand ultimately digital transformation is about meeting these everescalating expectations but often an organizations entry point is a transformation initiative that addresses a specific means to this end such as


automating business processes


defending against disruption


dealing with change effectively


enabling ondemand access to more resources with fewer limits

covid19 pandemic the ultimate driver 

graph chart representing digital transformation caused by covid 19
in 2020 the covid19 pandemic laid bare every organizations digital transformation efforts and progress or lack thereof manufacturers learned just how quickly and effectively they could get new products to market retailers scrambled to provide customers with new and safer ways to shop employers adopted or expanded technologies that let employees work from home

among operational workflows supply chains were the most glaringly exposed supply chains are always vulnerable according to the mckinsey global institute supply chain disruptions lasting one month or longer occur every 37 years but shortly after the pandemic began the united states suddenly imported almost 50 less from major trading partners companies were forced to undergo years or decades worth of supply chain transformation in weeks or months

the arrival of the pandemic forced us to reconsider the capabilities we had at our fingertips and adapt them to the circumstances we now face daily take video conferencing for example weve had this capability for years but we never quite realized its full potential now video calls are an essential part of our day proving their worth far beyond hosting meetings remotely

patients can have a video consultation with their doctor and have their prescription made available at their closest pharmacy it benefits the doctor the patient and everyone who may come into contact with the patient this highlights the rapid acceleration of digital transformation out of necessity  but also how the right technology can enhance employee and customer safety 

2 what role have technologies such as ai cloud and iot played in the digital revolution 

enterprises will look back at the start of the 2020s as a moment when they either seized opportunities or naively hoped old ways of doing business would survive smarter businesses realize that its a critical time to meet peoples evolving needs and give their customers exceptional experiences business transformation is the key to accomplishing these goals studies show

as disruption and volatility may continue for the foreseeable future the organizations that apply humanfocused strategies business transformation will determine who thrives in the new landscape ahead and the new capabilities of emerging and advancing technologies will be positioned to lead in the new normal to come

transformational technologies

virtually any digital technology can play a role in an organizations digital transformation strategy but technologies that figure to play a central role today and in the near future include 


digitization


artificial intelligence and automation


cloud computing 


microservices


internet of things


blockchain 

combining multiple technologies including cloud cognitive ai mobile and the internet of things iot digital reinvention rethink customer and partner relationships from a need use or aspirationfirst perspective digital reinvention helps organizations create unique compelling experiences for their customers partners employees and other stakeholders these benefits arise regardless of whether enablement or fulfillment of the experience involves the direct provision of products or services or orchestration of products or services from partner organizations by way of a business ecosystem the most successful digitally reinvented businesses establish a platform of engagement for their customers acting as an enabler conduit and partner 

how cloud fits into the bigger picture 

the ongoing digital revolution affects individuals and businesses alike increasingly social networks and digital devices are the default means for engaging government businesses and civil society as well as friends and family members people use mobile interactive tools to determine who to trust where to go and what to buy this means that the last best experience that people have anywhere becomes the minimum expectation for the experience they want everywhere including in the enterprise given the competitive landscape this means that enterprises must undertake their own digital transformations rethink what their customers value most and create operating models that take advantage of what is newly possible for competitive differentiation the challenge for the enterprise is how fast and how far to go down the path to digital transformation and cloud adoption

increasing customer expectations and a more competitive business context have placed tremendous pressure on business leaders to change the way they set their strategies and run their organizations new requirements to incorporate more information and greater interactivity quickly drive up costs and complexity

futuristic digital background connecting different technologies to cloud
business leaders have long used information technology to improve productivity and efficiency reach new markets and optimize supply chains what is new is that customer expectations have changed

how can enterprises best respond to this shift 
how can they take advantage of the opportunity to innovate and grow through technology adoption  
how can they do all this costefficiently
this is the domain of digital transformation and its intersection with cloud adoption digital transformation incorporates the change associated with the application of digital technology in all aspects of society cloud adoption is the way in which businesses implement digital transformation

in our work with clients we have found that enterprises that can develop and effectively execute a digital transformation strategy and take full advantage of new technologies such as cloud are able to transform their business models and set a new direction for entire industries

we believe the most crucial decision that a company can make to successfully pursue a digital transformation strategy is to wholeheartedly yet thoughtfully adopt the cloud as the it platform of choice we have observed many companies that have successfully used cloud adoption to rapidly advance their digital transformation strategy we have also seen companies make unsuccessful cloud adoption decisions that have hampered or set back their pace of digital transformation what we will show you in this book is how to model your decisionmaking process after the successful transformations while avoiding the common pitfalls weve seen in the unsuccessful transformations

we are going to explore the fundamentals of cloud computing and the role it plays as a digital transformation driver introduction to cloud computing and its capabilities   

introduction

in this topic well define cloud computing and discuss its capabilities and benefits in a business context 

throughout this topic we will attempt to answer the following questions 

what is cloud computing
what are the capabilities of the cloud
1 what is cloud computing 

cloud computing transforms it infrastructure into a utility it lets you plug into infrastructure via the internet and use computing resources without installing and maintaining them onpremises 

what is cloud computing  

digital transformation is the change associated with the application of digital technology in all aspects of society cloud adoption is the way in which businesses implement digital transformation

cloud presents many benefits including greater agility speed to market and improved efficiency cloud can open the door to enhanced user experiences and new markets but only a small percentage of workloads have made it to the cloud why because the remaining core business workloads are harder to move share dependencies and require a more thoughtful and holistic approach

you need to transform to keep up with the pace of modern environments considering factors such as dynamic market conditions speed of technology faster and leaner competition and ubiquitous innovation and the starting point needs to meet you where you are on your journey 

image showing a person with applications in the cloud business connected
cloud computing sometimes referred to simply as the cloud is the use of computing resources  servers database management data storage networking software applications and special capabilities such as blockchain and artificial intelligence ai  over the internet as opposed to owning and operating those resources yourself onpremises

compared to traditional it cloud computing offers organizations a host of benefits the costeffectiveness of paying for only the resources you use faster time to market for missioncritical applications and services the ability to scale easily affordably and  with the right cloud provider  globally and much more see what are the benefits of cloud computing below and many organizations are seeing additional benefits from combining public cloud services purchased from a cloud services provider with private cloud infrastructure they operate themselves to deliver sensitive applications or data to customers partners and employees

increasingly cloud computing is becoming synonymous with computing for example in a 2019 survey of nearly 800 companies 94 were using some form of cloud computing many businesses are still in the first stages of their cloud journey having migrated or deployed about 20 of their applications to the cloud and are working out the unique security compliance and geographic implications of moving their remaining missioncritical applications but move they will industry analyst gartner predicts that more than half of companies using cloud today will move to an allcloud infrastructure by next year 2021

2 what are the key capabilities of cloud computing 

thanks to its speed scale and capacity the cloud offers more functionality with more automation than nearly every onpremises solution

cloud capabilities 


cloud is built around services


cloud is automated


cloud usually oversees your networking

image showing a person using mobile to book cab successfully
if the cloud was a rental car 

1 rental cars are available when and where you need them 


click to flip
when we fly somewhere to go on vacation we usually rent a car it is very easy to do and in most areas in the united states you need a car in order to get around when we go skiing in colorado we rent a car when we go to michigan in the summer we rent a different one it doesnt matter if the cars are provided by different rental car companies they serve the same purpose and are designed to do the same thing very similar to cloud computing we can access the computing resources we need when and where we need them 


click to flip
2 when you rent a car you pay only for the time you use it 


when we travel to these various cities obviously it doesnt make sense to buy a car in each one of them we dont need a car all the time so we dont want to own it all the time when we have these temporary needs we rent a car for the location and time that we need it without being required to buy and maintain it permanently in a typical cloud computing environment it works the same way companies pay only for what they actually use instead of saving the cost of buying and maintaining a car they are saving the money required to buy large computers 


3 booking a rental car is easy to do by yourself 


before we go on a trip we never actually call and talk to a person at the rental car company to reserve a rental car all of the rental car companies have websites designed for you to enter the type of car you need where you want to pick it up and for what time period you want to use the car this same selfservice method is used for cloud computing companies can log into websites to request the specific computer resources that they need 


4 the rental car company has a large number of vehicles that it can rent and can buy more cars to rent if there are consistently many requests 


car rental companies have many types of cars that they rent out but effectively the cars all serve the same purpose they get you from point a to point b however there is a difference between a compact car and a luxury suv to account for this rental car companies have the flexibility to offer various prices for various car sizes they also have the ability to provide a higher class car than reserved this allows them to have a smaller total number of cars than what would be needed if they had to keep a specific number of each class of cars this practice is like grouping a large number of computers together to form a cloud the computers might be different models or have different sizes of hardware but when you group them all together into a resource pool you ensure you have enough power to go around 


5 you can rent a different type of car for different situations 


when you go to the beach you rent a convertible when you go skiing you rent something with an allwheel drive and a ski rack when you are driving a long distance you select something that gets good gas mileage each one of these vehicles would likely have a different cost associated with them similarly in cloud computing you can select different cloud services to fit your various needs you could select a cloud service with a lot of resources behind it for a very processingintensive need task or you could select a cheaper cloud service if you need fewer resources in cloud terminology this is sometimes referred to as being fit for purpose 


6 you arent responsible for maintaining a rental car 


oil changes tire rotations and changing the spark plugs are all things that you dont have to worry about when you are renting a car the rental car company handles all of these maintenance issues so you dont have to realistically this is built into the price of renting the car but for the renter it is worth it to have that peace of mind just as rental car providers maintain their fleet cloud providers maintain the hardware and software running the cloud platform so that the cloud consumers dont need to worry about it 


7 if your rental car breaks down or you have an accident the rental car company will bring you a new car 


they would also take care of driving or towing the original car away something similar happens in a cloud environment if something happens to your cloud instance the cloud provider can very quickly and easily create a new instance for you this ability to quickly stand up to new services after a problem is referred to as disaster recovery 


8 if you are traveling with a big group you can rent multiple cars 


sometimes my wife and i go on vacation with a group of friends between all the people and luggage there isnt enough room in one car even a big one fortunately rental car companies have many cars available to rent and when we have this increased demand we can rent multiple cars in cloud computing this is referred to as elasticity when we need additional resources or cars we can rent them when we no longer need the additional space we can return the car to the provider and no longer need to pay for it 


why it matters 
cloud computing offers many advantages over traditional onprem it architecture with cloud an organization has access to centralized servers and software without the need for a complex it staff to program secure and maintain it cloud is also automated providing you with access to its services ondemand this allows organizations to scale up or down quickly as their business needs fluctuate

IBM Automation,what is automation what does ibm automation involve how would you define automation under the emerging technologies field,"what is automation
an aipowered software that helps businesses complete routine and repetitive tasks with low human intervention ibm utilizes four different types of automation to help our clients work more efficiently new to automation check out this automation overview

what are the types of automation
basic automation  basic automation takes simple rudimentary tasks and automates them this level of automation is about digitizing work by using tools to streamline and centralize routine tasks such as using a shared messaging system instead of having information in disconnected silos business process management bpm and robotic process automation rpa are types of basic automation check out this use case from deloitte to see basic automation in action

 

process automation  process automation manages business processes for uniformity and transparency it is typically handled by dedicated software and business apps using process automation can increase productivity and efficiency within your business it can also deliver new insights into business challenges and suggest solutions process mining and workflow automation are types of process automation check out this use case from credigy to see process automation in action

 

integration automation  integration automation is where machines can mimic human tasks and repeat the actions once humans define the machine rules one example is the digital worker in recent years people have defined digital workers as software robots that are trained to work with humans to perform specific tasks they have a specific set of skills and they can be hired to work on teams check out this use case from cobmax to see integration automation in action

 

artificial automation  the most complex level of automation is artificial intelligence ai automation the addition of ai means that machines can learn and make decisions based on past situations they have encountered and analyzed for example in customer service virtual assistants powered can reduce costs while empowering both customers and human agents creating an optimal customer service experience check out the journey of the autonomous ship the mayflower to see ai powered automation in action robotic process automation rpa is the automation of computercentric processes using software robots that can emulate human actions in the computer these software robots or bots can be attended or unattended 

the processes that are candidates for automation are generally timeconsuming and highly repetitive processes that is they follow a fixed and long flow with predefined rules and welldetermined input and output parameters a specialized type of rpa designed to help humans on their daily tasks by automating the mechanical part of their everyday work these types of bots require human interaction to be able to complete their automation goal unattended bots dont need human interaction to complete their automation goal they might rely on human data input like documents or email messageshyperautomation is the combination of advanced technologies such as machine learning artificial intelligence and process mining in combination with rpa to identify and automate significant processes and also improve existing automation  accuracy since bots eliminate errors during data entry in systems

 bots have high availability with uninterrupted executions

 bots can process high volumes of data with concurrent processing
